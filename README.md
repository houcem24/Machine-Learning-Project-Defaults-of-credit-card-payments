Credit Card Defaults Prediction

This repository implements a machine learning pipeline to predict defaults of credit card payments. Given historical data about credit card customers, the goal is to build models that can identify which clients are likely to default, enabling preventive measures.

üîç Workflow

Here‚Äôs the typical pipeline followed in this project:

Data exploration & visualization

Understanding distributions, features, missing values, correlations.

Visualizing default vs non-default across different attributes.

Data preprocessing

Handling missing data (if any), encoding categorical variables, scaling/norming.

Splitting into training and test sets.

Model training

Trying different classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.).

Tuning parameters where applicable.

Evaluation

Using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC AUC.

Possibly inspecting confusion matrix and other diagnostic plots.

Conclusions

Which model performed best?

Which features seem the most predictive?

Limitations & possible next steps.

üîß Setup & Usage

To run or reproduce this project, here are the steps:

Install required packages (create a virtual environment for safety):

pip install -r requirements.txt


If you don‚Äôt have a requirements.txt, typical packages you‚Äôll need include:
pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib / seaborn, etc.

Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook Projet_ML_VF1.ipynb


or

jupyter lab


Run the notebook cells in order:

Load data

Preprocess

Train models

Evaluate and visualize results

üìà Possible Improvements

Here are ideas you could implement to enhance the project:

Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearch, RandomSearch) to improve model performance.

Cross-validation to ensure robustness.

Feature engineering: create new features, better encode categorical variables.

Use ensemble methods (e.g. Gradient Boosting, XGBoost).

Address class imbalance (if defaults are much fewer than non-defaults) via oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic methods (SMOTE).

Deployment: build a simple interface (dashboard or API) to use the model for prediction in real time.
